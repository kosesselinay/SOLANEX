# SOLANEX - Graduation Project

SOLANEX is a decentralized NFT Marketplace application built on the Solana Blockchain. This project utilizes a range of technologies to provide a seamless and secure platform for trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Currently, SOLANEX is being developed as a mobile app using Flutter, but there are plans to expand it to the web in the future, utilizing Vue.js as the front-end framework.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-end:** Flutter, Vue.js (future expansion)
- **Back-end:** Node.js, Rust

## Features and Functionality

The SOLANEX marketplace aims to provide a user-friendly and efficient experience for buying, selling, and trading NFTs. The application leverages the Solana Blockchain to ensure secure and transparent transactions. Here are some notable features:

- **Mobile App:** The current development focus is on creating a mobile app using the Flutter framework. This allows users to access the marketplace easily from their smartphones.

- **Web Expansion:** In the future, SOLANEX will be expanded to the web, utilizing Vue.js as the front-end framework. This expansion will provide additional accessibility and flexibility for users.

- **Centralized Back-end (Node.js):** Node.js is used for the centralized portion of the application. Its event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O model enable high performance and scalability.

- **Decentralized Smart Contracts (Rust):** Rust is used to create smart contracts that facilitate secure and transparent exchange of NFTs within the SOLANEX marketplace. These smart contracts ensure the integrity of transactions and protect user assets.

## Future Plans

The development of SOLANEX is an ongoing process, and there are several plans for future enhancements:

- Expand the application to the web using Vue.js, providing a web-based interface for users.

- Continuously improve the mobile app by adding new features, optimizing performance, and enhancing user experience.

- Collaborate with artists and creators to onboard new NFT collections and foster a vibrant marketplace community.

## Conclusion

The development of SOLANEX has provided valuable experience in both front-end and back-end development, as well as exposure to cutting-edge technologies such as the Solana Blockchain. The project showcases the skills and knowledge gained during the development process and serves as a testament to the ability to create scalable and secure decentralized applications.

As a Software Engineer, the learnings from SOLANEX will continue to contribute to professional growth and development. Excitement abounds as SOLANEX looks to expand to the web, bringing the decentralized NFT marketplace to an even wider audience.
